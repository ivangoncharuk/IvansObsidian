Went to the gym today for the first time and Melat joined me. Learned that my #COSC-455 Project 1 was perfect and I was doing extra. Now we are finally doing real coding in literally all my classes. #COSC-457 we are doing SQL, #COSC-455 we are doing Emacs Lisp, #COSC-412 we are doing flutter. #COSC-350 we are doing Python with Raspberry Pi. And we have already been doing R in #MATH-330
