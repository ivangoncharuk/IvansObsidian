Had a dream about the matrix today. It was very vivid. We had one boring reality that we thought was real until we escaped. There was one weird show thing that the paranormal forces wanted to show us. There was really fast elevators down an underground sort of facility, but it felt very familiar. The elevators went down super fast, and connected a bunch of university hallways and dining halls. I felt like this setting of my dream Iâ€™ve had a dream in before. There was one real dimension that we went into and it all made sense until we had to go back in the simulation.
