## Reflection #reflect

Had a pretty chill first day of school. Managed to get my hold lifted so I can register for classes. I decided not to take Operating Systems this year just so my schedule stays a bit lighter. I only really have Tuesday and Thursday classes this semester with the occasional Monday class like today. I feel like this class is mainly online class with the rare in person class. I'm excited to see what we can do with this.
