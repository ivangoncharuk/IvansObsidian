## Reflection #reflect
Today I had to say goodbye to Fahmin as he went to vacation. I have to find another place to sleep. Fahmin and I decided to hit the music store before I dropped him off. He offered me some weed and dabs if I drove him to Ethans place which seemed like a steal to me. After dropping off Fahmin, I drove over to Nick's house and started working on my website. Nick's place is very depressing and I almost broke down crying because of my situation.
