## Reflection #reflect
This day was a little weird. We tripped today and I got to hang out with Melat and Fahmin. She didn't want to trip which is okay, I was just happy to see her. Of course Fahmin needed to go to his girlfriends house, but we made plans to see a movie so I'm happy we made some plan out of it. Never got to make the spaghetti and meatballs, though. Afterwards, he told me that he was going on vacation the following day for a week, and I needed to find another place before he came back. Worked more on my #fiverr business working on my [[Rough draft of website development gig]] and preparing for my [[Bestbuy GeekSquad]] interview.
