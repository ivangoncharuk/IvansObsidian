## Reflection 
Today, I was disappointed to wake up late. Fahmin and I had planned to smoke a joint before heading to Bri's house, but we couldn't find a lighter. We're planning to trip tomorrow morning. Later on, I had a conversation with Fahmin's parents about his lifestyle. They're concerned about him just smoking and not being proactive. They hope I can influence him positively, but I know Fahmin well – he would be upset with me if I tried to intervene, especially given his current mindset. On another note, I received an email regarding my domain name. It seems there's potential interest in purchasing it.
