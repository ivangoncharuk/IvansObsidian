## Reflection #reflect 
I keep thinking about this one dream I had a few nights ago, There was one scary part of the dream where I’m in some bedroom somewhere and outside I see colossally sized alien looking space ships outside just taking over the entire scenery. I thought it was the end of human civilization. It was a very eerie and dreadful moment and I am happy it didn’t last that long. I still think about it because maybe the dream could be linked to something? It felt so real.
