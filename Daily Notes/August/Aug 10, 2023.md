## Reflection #reflect
Today I woke up at around noon and Fahmin and I decided not to trip because he only went to sleep at 9am for some reason. Now the plan for today is to get some groceries, chill and study, and do some deliveries.  We are planning to leave around 4:30 or so do some orders and then I am dropping off Fahmin to Bris house for a couple hours.
