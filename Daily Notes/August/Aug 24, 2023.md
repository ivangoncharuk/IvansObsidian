## Reflection #reflect

Kinda upset about having #todo this stupid [[PAPER - Choosing Civility]] I have to write in order to take my #fall2023 classes. I'm seriously thinking about murder, but being civil about it ([[Civility]]). It was only today when I heard about this dumb [[Sticker Incident]], but basically it is because some front desk chick who signed me in to see my girlfriend was upset I talked back because I was upset she had to take away my Paca House sticker.
And I also have to re register and pay for my semester tomorrow, hopefully being able to have both holds lifted. Gotta finish this essay by tonight or I'm going to be stressed out.
