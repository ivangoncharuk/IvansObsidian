## Reflection #reflect
I began the day waking up at Fahmin's place; he had generously offered me refuge after the fallout with Yuri that left me without a home. As I pen down these thoughts, a heavy downpour surrounds me, making me pause and wait it out. My immediate goals include securing a job and finding a stable place to call home. There's hope on the horizon as Nick and I are venturing into a freelance business [[Rough draft of website development gig]] Once our clientele builds, steady work should follow. I am also creating other fiverr gigs like [[AI image generation gig]] so I can earn some more cash. With school on the near horizon, I'm feeling the weight of financial and living arrangements pressing on me. At 21, the reality of being completely independent is settling in. Thankfully, past experiences, especially long hours with Uber, have prepped me for this. Among other pressing matters, my studies for the CompTIA Security+ exam and the need to liaise with Towson about academic holds and scheduling loom overhead.
## Events of the Day #events
After dropping Fahmin off at his girlfriend's, I took some UberEats deliveries. Hunger soon struck, and I found solace in an iHop meal. My determination led me to apply to three distinct positions: Microcenter, Bestbuy GeekSquad, and the GeekSquad repair. Later in the day, I initiated the creation of my Fiverr page, even drafting some potential content for my advertisements.

**Events:**
1. Stayed at Fahmin's due to housing issues.
2. Worked UberEats and ate at iHop.
3. Applied to three job positions.
4. Initiated Fiverr page setup.
5. Drafted content for Fiverr advertisements.
