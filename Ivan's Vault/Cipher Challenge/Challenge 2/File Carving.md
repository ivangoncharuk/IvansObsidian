# File Carving

File carving is a technique used in computer forensics to extract data from a disk or file. The method is particularly useful when the metadata that would normally be used to identify the files and their boundaries has been corrupted or is otherwise missing. In file carving, the data is identified and extracted based on file signatures (also known as "magic numbers"), data patterns, and other characteristics rather than metadata.

In this context, file carving could be employed to recover KDB files from a disk or a larger binary dump. You'd be looking for the "magic number" (`"CT2018"`) that indicates the beginning of a KDB file, then trying to reconstruct the entire file based on the known structure, even if the file system metadata that would normally point to this file is missing.

## Explanation of the Code Solution

### Overview of How KDB Files Work

- A KDB file begins with a header (`HEAD`) that contains a "magic number" and a pointer to the `ENTRY_LIST`.
- The `ENTRY_LIST` is an array of `ENTRY` items, each containing a name and a pointer to a `BLOCK_LIST`.
- Each `BLOCK_LIST` contains an array of `BLOCK` items, pointing to `DATA` that needs to be decrypted using the LFSR algorithm.

### Steps to Solve the Problem

1. **Read and Validate Header**: Open the file and read the first 6 bytes to verify the magic number. Read the next 4 bytes to find the pointer to the `ENTRY_LIST`.
    
2. **Navigate to ENTRY_LIST**: Use the pointer to move to the position of the `ENTRY_LIST` in the file.
    
3. **Read ENTRIES**: Loop through the entries in the `ENTRY_LIST` until you find the value `0xFFFFFFFF`, which marks the end.
    
4. **Read BLOCK_LIST for Each ENTRY**: For each `ENTRY`, read its `BLOCK_LIST`.
    
5. **Decrypt Each Block**: Each `BLOCK` points to `DATA` which is encoded. Use the `Crypt` function to decrypt this data.
    
6. **Output Decrypted Data**: After decrypting, append this data to an output string related to the `ENTRY`.
    
7. **Display Results**: Finally, print out each entry's name and its associated decoded data.
    

### Understanding the Code

- **Reading Header**:
    - `magic = f.read(6)` reads the first 6 bytes.
    - `entry_list_pointer = struct.unpack('<I', f.read(4))[0]` reads the next 4 bytes and unpacks them into an integer pointer.

- **Reading ENTRY_LIST**:
    - `f.seek(entry_list_pointer)` takes the file cursor to the `ENTRY_LIST`.
    - `while True:` loop iterates through each entry in the list.
    
- **Reading Each ENTRY**:
    - The `entry_name` is read byte-by-byte until a null terminator (`\x00`) is encountered.
    - `block_list_pointer = struct.unpack('<I', f.read(4))[0]` reads the next 4 bytes for the pointer to the `BLOCK_LIST`.
      
- **Reading and Decrypting BLOCKs**:
    - `f.seek(block_list_pointer)` takes the file cursor to the `BLOCK_LIST`.
    - `for _ in range(255):` loop iterates through each block in the list.
    - `Crypt(block_data, 0x4F574154)` is used to decrypt the data in each block.
      
- **Outputting Results**:
    - `print(f"{entry_name}: {decoded_data.decode('ascii')}")` prints out the decoded data for each entry.
