Cologne is a type of fragrance product that originated in the city of Cologne, Germany. It's typically less concentrated than [[Perfume]], containing around 2-5% [[Perfume]] oil dissolved in alcohol and water. Cologne is designed to be a lighter, more refreshing scent that can be applied more liberally than more concentrated fragrances. Here's an overview of different aspects:

### Tons of Different Scents

Colognes come in a plethora of scents, which can be broadly categorized into families like:

1. **Citrus**: Fresh and invigorating, with notes like lemon, bergamot, and orange.
2. **Woody**: Earthy and masculine, with notes like sandalwood, cedar, and vetiver.
3. **Floral**: Sweet and romantic, with notes like rose, jasmine, and lily-of-the-valley.
4. **Oriental**: Rich and sensual, with notes like vanilla, amber, and incense.
5. **Spicy**: Warm and inviting, with notes like cinnamon, cloves, and pepper.
6. **Aquatic**: Fresh and clean, with notes that evoke the sea or fresh rain.
7. **Gourmand**: Edible or dessert-like, with notes like chocolate, vanilla, or caramel.

### Makarios' Set

#### 1. Polo Ralph Lauren

Polo by Ralph Lauren is an iconic fragrance that was first launched in 1978. It's often described as a woody, chypre fragrance. It typically includes notes of tobacco, leather, and various woods, rounded out by some herbal and spice notes. It's considered a classic, and it's particularly well-suited for formal occasions or mature wearers.

#### 2. Knock off Amazon Cologne

Knock-off colognes aim to replicate the scent of more expensive, name-brand fragrances. They're usually cheaper but might not have the staying power or exact scent profile of the original. The quality can vary widely, and there's also the risk that the ingredients may not be as high quality or as well-tested as those in established brands.

#### 3. Another random cologne he spent $30 bucks on

At the $30 price point, you can still find good quality colognes, although they may not have the complexity or longevity of more expensive options. These are usually ideal for casual settings or for people who are new to wearing cologne and want to try out different scents without committing to a higher price point.

### How to Apply Cologne

1. **Less Is More**: Since cologne can be strong, it's best to start with a small amount and add more if needed.
2. **Apply to Pulse Points**: The heat helps to diffuse and amplify the aroma. Pulse points are the wrists, neck, and behind the ears.
3. **Don't Rub It In**: Rubbing breaks down the fragrance, causing it to fade more quickly.

### Storing Cologne

Proper storage can extend the life of your cologne. Keep it in a cool, dark place and away from temperature fluctuations.

### Allergies and Skin Sensitivity

Some people might be allergic to specific ingredients in cologne. Always do a patch test if you're trying a new brand for the first time.

### Ethical Considerations

Some colognes still make use of animal-derived ingredients or are tested on animals. If this is a concern, look for cruelty-free or vegan options.

That should give you a good overview of cologne, from the different scents available to what might be in your friend Makarios' collection!
