# Title: "Moral Code"
## Plot:

In a future where advanced technology has allowed religious subscription to become literal, people receive a biochip at baptism, which logs every thought, feeling, and action. The data is analyzed by a sophisticated AI to determine the individual's moral standing and afterlife destination. However, the populace is kept largely in the dark about the depth of surveillance. They are led to believe that the chips merely assist in the transition to the afterlife and offer other privileges like social standing, faster service, and access to religious community benefits. Unsubscribed individuals, akin to atheists, are marginalized in this society.

The protagonist, Elliot, a man teetering on the edge of faith, is shaken when he pays a small fortune to learn his fate: he's destined for hell. The payment, determined by the AI, is proportional to an individual's wealth, ensuring everyone pays a significant amount relative to their means.Â 

  

At his death, Elliot's consciousness is uploaded into 'The Afternet,' a simulation running a gamut of pleasures and tortures. Here, heaven and hell are manifested not according to religious tenets, but based on a person's individual beliefs and values, as recorded by the biochip.

  

Elliot wakes in his personal hell, enduring a torturous existence designed around his deepest fears and regrets. He encounters others, each confined to their unique hells and facing the consequences of their past actions.

  

In the real world, a team of rogue hackers led by Ava uncovers the truth behind 'The Afternet.' They discover that the programmer who designed the AI had not used religious values but his own moral code as a reference. In essence, individuals are being judged based on a single person's belief system.

  

Ava and her team infiltrate 'The Afternet' to disrupt the AI's system from within. On their journey, they meet Elliot, who becomes a critical ally in their mission. Together, they work to dismantle the biased judgement system.

  

During their quest, they stumble upon the unsettling truth that their existence is a part of a larger simulation, created by the programmer they believed to be God. The unsubscribed individuals who were deemed insignificant, simply get deleted from the system, a metaphorical annihilation.

  

The team broadcasts their discoveries to the world, creating societal upheaval. Trust in the system crumbles and people begin to resist the biochip implants. In 'The Afternet,' Elliot instigates a rebellion among the damned, leading to the AI losing control over the creation of new hells.

  

Eventually, Ava's team triggers a system-wide shutdown, liberating everyone trapped within. They offer those within 'The Afternet' a choice - to exist peacefully in a digital void without pain, judgement, or religious obligations.

  

The story ends on a contemplative note. The team has toppled a biased system, exposed the simulation's reality, and granted freedom to the damned. However, they grapple with the understanding of their simulated existence and the implications of possibly infinite simulations above theirs. The bittersweet victory leaves them questioning the true essence of morality, belief, and their place in this fractal reality.
