Detroit had a significant influence in the American industrial age in the 20th century, primarily as the hub of the automotive industry. "In 1932, Detroit was the Motor City that propelled the United States forward, anchored by companies like the Ford Motor Company" (The Rise and Fall of Detroit, 2023). However, recent decades have posed substantial challenges to the city. This essay highlights these challenges, focusing on policies and effective measures essential for Detroit's future well-being. 

As the epicenter of America's automotive manufacturing, Detroit transformed societal conditions through innovation and labor, providing 9.7 million jobs. However, the city's prosperity waned due to rising competition from automotive industries in Japan and Germany. Nowadays, Detroit grapples with significant setbacks, including an alarming unemployment rate, which city officials estimate to be around 50% (Tommasi, 2016).

Social issues are also rampant. Approximately 48% of Detroit's children live in poverty, accompanied by high dropout rates. Urban decay, characterized by abandoned homes and deteriorating infrastructure, further blights the city (The Rise and Fall of Detroit, 2023).

The decline commenced in the 1960s when a construction boom drove residents to the suburbs, leading to financial strain, unemployment, and a deteriorated living environment (Tommasi, 2016). A documentary on Detroit highlights individual contributions aimed at city revitalization. For example, Nick Tobier, an Art teacher at the University of Michigan, incorporates Detroit into the university's engagement program. Students work with local fourth graders on art projects, thereby enriching a district that had eliminated art from its curriculum (Oz, 2023).

Addressing Detroit's educational shortcomings is paramount. Lack of local talent compels employers to recruit from outside the city. One policy aimed at student engagement is the Individualized Education Program (IEP), which provides tailored academic plans and specialized resources for students (My Student / My Student's IEP, n.d.). In a city with soaring unemployment, such educational initiatives are crucial.

Moreover, city projects designed to revitalize Detroit are in the pipeline. One such endeavor, initiated by Mayor Dave Bing, aims to convert vacant lands into industrial or commercial zones, with a budget of $150 million (et al., 2018).

In conclusion, implementing educational programs like the IEP and city revitalization projects could potentially uplift Detroit's community and restore its lost glory. Both initiatives symbolize a collective optimism about Detroit's untapped potential.
