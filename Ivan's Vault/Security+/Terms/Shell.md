A shell is a program that takes your keyboard commands and gives them to the operating system to execute. It's the interface between you and the system. Think of it as a translator, taking your instructions and converting them into a language the system can understand. When you "get a shell" on a system, it means you've gained control and can interact with it. Types of shell connections include:

1. **Reverse shell:** Connects back to you from a target system.
2. **Bind shell:** Waits for your connection on a target system.
3. **Web shell:** Allows you to run commands via a web browser.

These can be created using various programming languages, like Python or Java.
