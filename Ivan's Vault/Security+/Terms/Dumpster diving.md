### The Threat of Dumpster Diving in Information Security

#### What is Dumpster Diving?

Dumpster diving involves searching through waste containers—commonly referred to as dumpsters—to retrieve discarded items. While this may sound innocuous, in the realm of information security, it can pose a substantial risk. A dumpster is not just a repository for waste; it can inadvertently become a goldmine of sensitive data.

#### Types of Information at Risk

1. **Personal or Business Documents**: Discarded mail, old memos, or printouts can contain valuable information.
    - **"Thanks for Bagging Your Garbage for Me!"**: Well-packaged garbage makes the search easier for the diver.
2. **Data for Further Attacks**: Information collected can serve as a springboard for more complex forms of attacks such as [[Impersonation]].
    - **Names for [[Impersonation]]**: Discarded mail or business cards could provide names to impersonate.
    - **Contact Information**: Discarded invoices or letters can provide phone numbers or addresses.

#### Timing Matters

1. **End-of-Month Disposal**: People often clean out files or discard documents at the end of the month, making this a prime time for dumpster diving.
2. **Trash Pickup Schedule**: Divers often plan their activities based on when the garbage will be collected to maximize their window of opportunity.

### Legality of Dumpster Diving

- **Generally Legal**: In many jurisdictions, once items are discarded as trash, they are considered public property.
- **Local Laws and Regulations**: There may be local laws or regulations that prohibit dumpster diving, especially in residential areas.
- **Private Property**: Dumpsters located on private property or behind "no trespassing" signs may be legally protected. Illegal entry to access a dumpster could constitute trespassing.

### How to Secure Against Dumpster Diving

#### Physical Security Measures

1. **Fencing and Locking Dumpsters**: A basic but effective way to deter unauthorized access.

#### Information Destruction

1. **Shred Your Documents**: Basic shredding can deter but not entirely prevent information recovery.
    - **Extreme Measures**: Some organizations, especially governmental bodies, incinerate sensitive documents to ensure they can't be recovered.

#### Self-Audit

1. **Examine Your Own Trash**: Periodically inspect what kind of information is being thrown away. This will give you a sense of what a dumpster diver might find.

#### Final Thoughts

Dumpster diving is a surprisingly effective, low-tech method that attackers can use to gather sensitive information. In many cases, it's perfectly legal, making it even more important for individuals and organizations to take proactive measures. Awareness of the risk and appropriate countermeasures can go a long way in ensuring that your trash doesn't become someone else's treasure.
