## Definition of Shoulder Surfing in Information Security

Shoulder surfing refers to the unauthorized act of obtaining sensitive and confidential information by directly observing someone's screen, keypad, or workspace. This can encompass a range of important data, including [[Personal Identifiable Information (PID)]], financial transactions, or proprietary company files.

## Motivations Behind Shoulder Surfing

Individuals or entities may engage in shoulder surfing for various reasons:

1. **Curiosity**: Some people might just be inquisitive, wondering what you're up to.
2. **Industrial Espionage**: Corporate spies may use this method to gain trade secrets or sensitive company data.
3. **Competitive Advantage**: Competitors might employ shoulder surfing to get an edge in the marketplace by acquiring your strategies or customer lists.
4. [[Impersonation]]: Attackers can use your information to steal your identity and steal more information such as bank details.

## High-risk Environments for Shoulder Surfing

The act is astonishingly simple to execute and can happen in various settings such as:

1. **Airports or Flights**: Places where people are in close proximity.
2. **Workspace with Hallway-facing Monitors**: Where anyone walking by can easily see your screen.
3. **Public Spaces like Coffee Shops**: These places often have people working on laptops, unaware of prying eyes.

## Advanced Techniques

Beyond direct observation, more advanced techniques of shoulder surfing can include:

1. **Long-range Observation**: Tools like binoculars or telescopes can be used, especially in urban environments where high vantage points are accessible.
2. **Remote Surveillance**: Unauthorized webcam access can provide a way for someone to observe your activities from a distance.

### Strategies for Preventing Shoulder Surfing

#### Control and Awareness

1. **Situational Awareness**: Always be cognizant of your surroundings. Know who is behind or near you, and whether they can see your screen.

#### Utilizing Privacy Filters

1. **Screen Privacy Filters**: These are physical filters that can be placed over your screen to limit viewing angles, thereby making it harder for someone to see the screen unless they are directly in front of it.
    - **Effectiveness**: It's remarkable how effective these can be in protecting your information.
    - **Adaptability**: They are also becoming increasingly common in smartphones and other mobile devices.

By employing a combination of awareness and technical safeguards, you can significantly reduce the risks associated with shoulder surfing, thereby securing your valuable information.

Remember, in the realm of information security, the human element is often the weakest link. Hence, personal vigilance is just as important as technological solutions.
