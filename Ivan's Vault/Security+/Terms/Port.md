A port is like a door into a computer. It's a virtual point where network connections start and finish. Different ports handle different types of traffic â€“ like one port for web requests and another for email. For example, website traffic usually goes to port 80, and secure web traffic (HTTPS) goes to port 443. There are two types of ports:

1. **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):** Requires a connection to be established before sending data.
2. **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):** Doesn't require a connection, so it's faster but less reliable.

Memorizing standard port numbers, like 21 for FTP or 80 for HTTP, helps in identifying services and planning attacks effectively.
