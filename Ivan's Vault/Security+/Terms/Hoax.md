### Definition
- A threat that doesn't actually exist
	- but they seem like the could be real
- still often consume lots of resources
	- forwarded emails, printed memorandums, wasted time
- Often an email
	- or facebook wall post, or tweet, or any social media
- some hoaxes will take your money
	- but perhaps not through electronic means
- A hoax about a virus can waste as much time as a regular virus
- [[Hoax in your email]]
- [[Hoax in the browser]]
### DeHoaxing
- It's the internet, so believe no one
	- Consider the source
- Cross reference
	- [Hoax-Slayer](http://www.hoax-slayer.net)
	- [Snopes](http://www.snopes.com)
- [[Spam]] filters can help
	- There are so many other ways...
- If it's too good to be true it probably is.
