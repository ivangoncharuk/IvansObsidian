### Understanding Watering Hole Attacks: A Stealthy Method of Network Compromise

#### What if Your Network is Fort Knox?

Imagine your network security protocols are top-notch:

- You never inserted that suspicious USB key you found in the parking lot.
- Your team is well-trained in recognizing and avoiding phishing emails.
- No one is falling prey to opening any email attachments or [[Spam]]

Even when traditional avenues of attack are effectively sealed off, attackers may opt for a more indirect approach.

#### The Watering Hole Strategy

If attackers can't reach you directly, they might just "have the mountain come to them," so to speak. This involves targeting a location where you are known to go, or "where the mountain hangs out": the watering hole. Successfully executing this attack involves a degree of research to identify such places frequented by the target.

##### The Basic Mechanism

In a watering hole attack, the assailant focuses on compromising a third-party website that the target group frequently visits. When members of this group visit the infected website, they too become compromised.

### Executing a Watering Hole Attack

#### Identifying the Victim Group's Habits

The first step is to ascertain which websites the target group commonly uses. This could be:

- An educated guess, perhaps a local coffee shop's Wi-Fi landing page or a favorite sandwich shop's online menu.

#### Infecting the Third-Party Site

- Utilize known site vulnerabilities or even send malicious email attachments to compromise the website.

#### Targeted or Broad Infections

- While the primary aim may be to infect specific individuals, the attacker might also opt to compromise all visitors to the site, casting a wider net.

### Case Study: Financial Sector Attacks in 2017

In January 2017, institutions like the Polish Financial Supervision Authority, National Banking and Stock Commission of Mexico, and even a state-owned bank in Uruguay were targeted.

- **Poisoned Watering Hole**: Visiting these sites would trigger the downloading of malicious JavaScript files.
- **Selective Poisoning**: The malware was served only to certain IP addresses that matched financial institutions.
- **Outcome Uncertain**: To this day, it's unclear whether these attacks succeeded before they were discovered.

### Defending Against Watering Hole Attacks

#### Multi-Layered Defense [[Defence-in-depth]]

- A robust defense system is never reliant on a single method. Multiple layers of security measures are crucial.

#### Network Traffic Control [[Firewall]]s and IPS

- Utilizing firewalls and intrusion prevention systems can stop malicious network traffic before it infiltrates the system.

#### Antivirus and Anti-Malware Updates

- In the case of the Polish Financial Supervision Authority, the malicious code was detected and halted by generic signatures in Symantec's anti-virus software.

By understanding the tactics employed in watering hole attacks and adopting a comprehensive, multi-layered approach to security, organizations can better protect themselves against this insidious form of cyber-attack.
