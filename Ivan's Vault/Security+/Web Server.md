#SY0-601 
A web server is an application that manages internet traffic to and from a website. It's like a traffic controller, directing incoming requests to the right pages and sending responses back. However, because they're open to the public and connected to the internet, web servers can be vulnerable to attacks. Common vulnerabilities include:

1. **Broken Access Control:** Users can access things they shouldn't.
2. **Cryptographic Failures:** Encryption isn't done properly, risking data exposure.
3. **Injection:** The server doesn't correctly handle user data, allowing for malicious actions.
