# Practice Tests 2

## Unknown words (TODO)

- Rootkit
	- A set of software tools that enable unauthorized access to a computer system while hiding in its presence, usually by masking itself as a legitimate program. OFten used by hackers to control a system without the users' knowledge.
- Fileless virus
	- A virus that operates in a computers memory rather than its' disk which makes it harder to detect and remove. It typically infiltrates a system via vulnerable software and stays resident in the computers memory. There is no file on the system that holds this virus, hence the name.
- backdoor
	- A hidden method of bypassing normal authentication to gain unauthorized access. It can be created by software developers or attackers to allow authorized or unauthorized users to bypass normal security measures and gain root access.
- PUP (Potentially Unwanted Program)
	- Potentially Unwanted Program is a program/application is software that a user may see as unwanted or unnecessary with the user's consent. Not explicitly classified as malware, it may adversely affect computer security, performance, and compromise user privacy, or display unsolicited ads.
- pcap
	- (Packet Capture). Refers to a network packet capturing using a packet capture/sniffing tool, like wireshark, which intercepts network traffic packets for analysis and can be stored in a pcap file format (like txt or jpg) 
- RAT
	- (Remote Access Trojan) a type of malware that creates a backdoor into a system that allows for complete remote administrative control. Typically used for illicit access and control. 
-  MaaS
	- (Malware as a Service) The act of selling, purchasing, or renting malware and deployment services to other hackers or malicious actors on the dark web, which makes sophisticated cyberattacks accessible to a broader audience.
- pfSense
	- An open source software widely used for network security. Based on FreeBSD, it is mainly tailored for use as a firewall and router entirely managed on a web interface.
- c2 server
	- (Command and Control Server) Used by attackers to maintain communication and control with compromised systems. This is a tool threat actors have in their arsenal to issue commands on other machines, usually a whole network of them, for the purpose of launching and controlling cyber attacks on their chosen targets.
- honeypot
	- A security mechanism meant to detect, deflect, or study hacking attempts by setting up a fake target to mimic a vulnerable system to lure/attract potential attackers to study and collect information about them such as their identity, motivations, and attack methods.
- Replay attack
	- A type of security attack where a malicious actor eavesdrops on a secure network connection, intercepts it, and then fraudulently delays and resends it to the receiver to misdirect the receiver into doing what the actor wants. 
	- It can be prevented by using strong digital signatures, time stamps, and information from the previous communication transaction such as a value of an incrementing sequence number. 
- botnet
	- A network of, usually private, internet connected compromised systems/devices and controlled as a group without the users' knowledge. Usually used for large attacks like DDoS that floods networks with large internet traffic to shut them down.
- bot
	- A compromised, malware-infected computer that carries out various tasks set by someone other than the devices' legitimate user, often part of a bigger network of bots known as a botnet. 
	- Bad bots, which make up a staggering 38% of all internet traffic, perform malicious attacks that allow an attacker to remotely control over these affected computers. 
- AAA (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting)
	- A security framework for intelligently controlling access to computer resources, enforcing policies, and auditing usage. AAA and its combined process plays a key role in network management by screening its users, and keeping track of their activity while they are connected. 
	- **Authentication** involves by screening their user about who they claim they are to obtain authorization for usage, by providing information like login information such as a password (something you know), a USB key (something you have), or a biometric such as a fingerprint or facial recognition (something you are).
	- **Authorization** dictates what a user is allowed to do in a network/system. A user can be granted or revoked access to certain areas of a network. It is different from authentication since authentication simply checks a user identity and authorization dictates what they can or cannot do.
	- **Accounting** is keeping track of what users on the network do while they are logged in, such as: their IP address, the time spent on the network, the data/packets they sent or received, the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) they used, or the different services they accessed. Accounting may be used to analyze trends, audit user activity, and provide more accurate billing.
- Intranet
	- An intranet is a smaller internal private network which is only accessible within an organizations staff, often used to share company information internally. 
- Extranet
	- An extranet, similar to an intranet, but different. A private controlled network 
- Honeynet
	- 
- cryptomalware
- computer worm
- Dictionary attack
- Spraying attack
- Birthday attack
- Rainbow tables?
- malicious usb
	- GPS tracking
	- Capturing keystrokes
	- Sending and receiving commands 
	- Delivering and executing malware
-  Pivoting
-  Bluejacking
- Cloning
- Rooting
- API
-  ML
-  RAD
-  VR
- KPA
