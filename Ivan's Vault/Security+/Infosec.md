Information Security, commonly referred to as **Infosec**, is the practice of defending information from unauthorized access, disclosure, disruption, modification, perusal, inspection, recording, or destruction. It encompasses a broad range of practices, tools, and methodologies to ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

---

**Network and Infrastructure Security**

- **Definition**: Focuses on protecting an organization's IT infrastructure, including networks, servers, workstations, and networked devices from threats.
- **Key Concepts**:
    - **[[Firewall]]**: Systems that filter incoming and outgoing traffic based on a defined set of security rules.
    - **[[Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)]]**: Monitors networks for malicious activities and logs or alerts when suspicious activity is detected.
    - **[[Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)]]**: Proactively denies or modifies traffic based on policy settings.
    - **[[VPN (Virtual Private Network)]]**: Creates a secure encrypted connection over a less secure network, like the Internet.
    - **[[Network Segmentation]]**: Dividing a computer network into subnetworks to boost performance and improve security.

---

**Application Security**

- **Definition**: Ensures the security of software applications. This includes measures taken during the application's design, development, and deployment stages.
- **Key Concepts**:
    - **[[Secure Code Review]]**: Evaluating application source code for vulnerabilities.
    - **[[Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP)]]**: Monitors application behavior during execution and prevents attacks in real-time.
    - **[[Web Application Firewalls (WAF)]]**: Protects web applications by monitoring and filtering HTTP traffic.

---

**Security Testing**

- **Definition**: A process to determine that an information system protects data and maintains functionality as intended.
- **Key Concepts**:
    - **[[Penetration Testing (Pentest)]]**: Simulated cyberattacks on a computer system to evaluate its security.
    - **[[Vulnerability Assessment]]**: Systematic examination of systems for security vulnerabilities.
    - **[[Red Team Assessment]]**: A goal-oriented approach where external teams emulate real-world cyberattacks.
    - [[**Blue Team Assessment**]]: Defensive team that counters the red team's efforts and improves defense mechanisms.

---

**Systems Auditing**

- **Definition**: An in-depth review and evaluation of operating procedures and system controls.
- **Key Concepts**:
    - **[[Access Controls Review]]**: Ensure only authorized users can access certain systems.
    - **[[Log Analysis]]**: Evaluating logs to detect anomalies and unauthorized activities.
    - **[[Compliance Audits]]**: Ensures systems comply with industry regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

---

**Business Continuity Planning**

- **Definition**: The process of creating systems to prevent and recover from potential threats to a company.
- **Key Concepts**:
    - **[[Disaster Recovery (DR)]]**: The strategy for restoring critical operations after a catastrophic event.
    - **[[Backup and Restore]]**: Methods and procedures to regularly backup system data and restore it when needed.

---

**Digital Forensics**

- **Definition**: The process of uncovering and interpreting electronic data for an investigation.
- **Key Concepts**:
    - **[[Chain of Custody]]**: Ensures evidence is tracked and remains unaltered.
    - **[[Disk Imaging]]**: Creating an exact copy of a storage device.
    - **[[Artifact Recovery]]**: Retrieving specific data or remnants from a storage device.

---

**Incident Detection and Response**

- **Definition**: The process of identifying, managing, and mitigating security incidents.
- **Key Concepts**:
    - **[[Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)]]**: Solutions that provide real-time analysis of security alerts generated by hardware and software.
    - **[[Incident Response Plan (IRP)]]**: A structured approach detailing the processes to follow when a cybersecurity incident occurs.
    - **[[Threat Hunting]]**: Proactively looking for signs of malicious activity within an organization that may not be detected by other security measures.
