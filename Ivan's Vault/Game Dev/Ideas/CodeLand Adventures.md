#idea
Create a game using these ideas: 
- Fish for code calls
- Mine for code calls
- To get rid of bugs, you have to actually kill them manually
- Move around using the code-calls you found
- To mine for bitcoin, you actually mine for it with a pickaxe 

**"CodeLand Adventures"**

**Objective**: Collect as many code-calls as possible to move around, fix bugs, and mine for Bitcoin. The more efficient your code, the more Bitcoin you earn.

**Game Mechanics**:

1. **Setting**: The game is set in a vast virtual land filled with rivers, mines, and a dynamic environment. Players can move around, interact with the environment, and face challenges.
    
2. **Moving**:
    
    - Players start with a few basic code-calls that allow them to move around.
    - To gain more movement abilities (e.g., jumping, sprinting, flying), players need to fish or mine for more advanced code-calls.
3. **Fishing for Code-Calls**:
    
    - Players visit a river or pond.
    - Cast a line with bait (basic algorithms) to attract code-calls.
    - The quality of the bait determines the type of code-call you might catch.
    - Some rare code-calls might provide special abilities or power-ups.
4. **Mining for Code-Calls**:
    
    - Players enter the mines scattered around the map.
    - Using their existing code, they can carve out sections of the mine.
    - Inside the rock, players might find buried code-calls that unlock new abilities or enhance existing ones.
    - The deeper you go, the better the code-calls. But, there's increased risk of bugs.
5. **Battling Bugs**:
    
    - Bugs are enemies that hinder player progress. They can be minor (e.g., slow you down) or major (e.g., crash your system).
    - Players must manually find and kill them by implementing patches or using special code-calls.
    - Major bugs might require teaming up with other players or using multiple code-calls in tandem.
6. **Mining for Bitcoin**:
    
    - Scattered throughout the world are special Bitcoin mines.
    - Instead of using a virtual rig, players use a pickaxe (an algorithm) to dig through lines of blockchain.
    - The faster and more efficient your algorithm (pickaxe), the more Bitcoin you mine.
    - To enhance the pickaxe, players can implement the code-calls they've gathered from fishing and mining.

**Features**:

1. **Multiplayer**: Players can team up to fish, mine, and battle bugs together. They can also trade code-calls or challenge each other in mini-games.
    
2. **Dynamic Environment**: The world of CodeLand changes based on collective player actions. Over-mined areas might become unstable, overfished waters can go barren, and unresolved bugs might spread to affect a larger area.
    
3. **Leaderboard**: Players can compete to be the most efficient coder, the wealthiest Bitcoin miner, or the most renowned bug-squasher.
    
4. **Customization**: Players can customize their avatars, build homes using the code-calls, and even create their own mini-games or challenges for other players.
