### 2D Game Ideas
  
1. **Color-Switch Runner**: A side-scrolling runner game where the character can change colors to pass through obstacles of the same color.
	- This game has high revenue potential due to its addictive nature and simplicity. You could add various cosmetic items, new levels, and power-ups as in-app purchases. The concept is simple but can be made challenging and engaging enough to keep players coming back.
2. [[Rhythm Gardener]]: You must plant, water, and harvest crops in time with the rhythm of the music.
	- Mixing rhythm and farming simulation could make for a highly engaging game. The mechanics of rhythm games are generally very popular, and combining that with the already well-liked genre of farming sims could create a very popular game.
3. [[SeeSaw Balance]]: A game where you must balance different shaped objects on a seesaw for a certain period to win.
	- This could be one of the simplest to develop as it is largely physics-based, and the mechanics can be implemented without too many complex assets or level designs. You would just need different shapes and a balance mechanism. Godot has built-in physics engines that can make this quite straightforward.
4. [[Mind the Gap]]: A game where you play a subway train conductor trying to perfectly align the train with the platform for maximum points.
5. [[CraneMaster]]: Operate a construction crane to move building materials from point A to B. As you progress, the shapes become more irregular, and the drop zones more constrained.
6. [[Time Loop Heist]]: Plan and execute a heist in a building where time loops every 60 seconds. Use the loop to learn patterns, avoid guards, and finally steal the treasure. Each loop allows you to place one item or action (like a distraction) to aid in your mission.
7. [[CodeLand Adventures]]: Collect as many function-calls as possible to move around, fix bugs, and mine for Bitcoin. The more efficient your code, the more Bitcoin you earn.
8. [[Call of the Sea - Abyssal Expedition]]: a procedurally generated, action-adventure game set in the deep ocean. You're an experienced treasure diver with a lifeline that supplies you with oxygen. Explore sunken ships, lost cities, and underwater caves to collect valuable treasure, but bewareâ€”dangerous sea creatures lurk in the depths. Manage your health, oxygen, and stamina as you decide whether to risk delving deeper or reel yourself back to safety.
9. **Sticky Climber**: A climbing game where the player is a sticky blob that can stick to and slide along walls to avoid falling obstacles.
10. **Two-Sides**: A platformer game where you play two characters simultaneously in mirrored worlds.
### 3D Game Ideas

1. **Air Traffic Tetris**: Stack landing airplanes on runways as if they were Tetris blocks. 
2. **Marble Galaxy**: Roll a marble through a celestial 3D obstacle course, collecting stars and avoiding black holes.

3. **Micro-Golf**: A mini-golf game but in unconventional locations like a kitchen table, office desk, etc.

4. **Sculptor's Dream**: Create sculptures by chipping away at blocks of material. The closer you get to a pre-determined shape, the higher your score.

### Overall Recommendation

**Color-Switch Runner** may offer the best balance of revenue potential and ease of development. It's a concept that's easy to understand but has a lot of room for added complexity and depth, which makes it both accessible and potentially addictive. The art assets can also be relatively simple, saving on development time, but you can make them vibrant and visually appealing.

**Rhythm Gardener** would be a solid bet for popularity but might require more extensive development, especially syncing gameplay to music and creating various farming activities.

If you're looking for a game that's easiest to make, **SeeSaw Balance** should be relatively straightforward, though its popularity and revenue potential might not be as high as the other two.

In the end, your skill set, interest in the genre, and development resources will also play a big role in which game idea you should choose.
