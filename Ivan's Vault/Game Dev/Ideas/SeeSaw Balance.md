**Concept**: 

Discover the addictive joy of perfect balance in "SeeSaw Balance". This physics-based game challenges players to balance a series of oddly shaped objects on a seesaw within a time limit, bringing a fresh twist to a classic balancing act.

---

### Core Mechanics:

1. **Physics-Based Gameplay**: Utilize real-world physics to balance various objects on a seesaw.
  
2. **Shape Diversity**: Use a variety of shapes ranging from simple blocks to complex polygons.
  
3. **Time Limit**: Each level comes with a countdown timer. Balance all objects before time runs out to win.
  
4. **Modifiers**: Environmental factors like wind or rotating platforms can add an extra layer of challenge.

### Gameplay Loop:

1. **Selection**: Start by selecting a few objects from a conveyor belt of shapes that move horizontally across the screen.
  
2. **Placement**: Drag and drop these objects onto the seesaw, aiming to maintain balance.

3. **Adjustment**: Make quick adjustments to avoid tipping, especially as new shapes become available.
  
4. **Completion**: Once all objects are balanced, you advance to the next level with new shapes and challenges.
  
5. **Upgrades and Power-Ups**: Use points earned to purchase one-time-use power-ups like freeze time, auto-balance, or shape modifiers.

### Monetization:

1. **Unlockable Themes**: Offer aesthetically pleasing backgrounds and seesaw designs as in-app purchases.

2. **Advanced Power-Ups**: Special power-ups can be bought to make challenging levels easier.
  
3. **Ad Removal**: One-time payment to remove ads.

### Technical Requirements:

1. **Physics Engine**: Fundamental to the gameplay. Godot's built-in physics engine should suffice.

2. **Art Assets**: Requires various shapes, a seesaw, and background themes.
  
3. **UI/UX**: Minimalistic interface focusing on drag-and-drop mechanics and easy navigation.
  
4. **Timer and Scoring System**: Implement a countdown timer and scoring based on balance duration and the number of objects used.

### Development Time:

Estimated 2-3 months for a minimal viable product, shorter if leveraging existing physics libraries and assets.
