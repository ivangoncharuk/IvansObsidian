### Pitch: Time-Loop Heist

---

**Concept**: 

Welcome to "Time-Loop Heist," where you're both the mastermind and the foot soldier in executing the perfect robbery. You have a building to infiltrate, but there's a twist: time loops every 60 seconds. Within each loop, you get to observe guard movements, discover secret paths, or set up a decoy or trap. The challenge? You can only perform one significant action per loop. Strategically stack your actions across multiple loops to disable alarms, distract guards, and grab the loot.

### Core Mechanics:

1. **Time-Looping**: Every 60 seconds, the game world resets, but your knowledge and any prep work (e.g., a hacked terminal, a disabled camera) remain.
  
2. **Action Limit**: You can perform only one significant action in each loop—like disabling a camera, setting a trap, or studying a guard's behavior.
  
3. **Stealth and Strategy**: Choose when to sneak past guards, when to disable alarms, and when to actually make a grab for the treasure.

4. **Resource Management**: Limited inventory space means you must plan carefully about what to carry—gadgets, keys, or weapons.

5. **Multiple Endings**: Depending on how many loops you take, how many alarms you trip, etc., you receive different heist 'grades.'

### Gameplay Loop:

1. **Mission Briefing**: Each level starts with an overview of the target—what you're stealing, where it is, and what obstacles stand in your way.
  
2. **Recon Phase**: Spend the first few time-loops gathering information. Learn the layout, where guards patrol, and where key objectives are located.
  
3. **Setup Phase**: Use subsequent loops to set up for the heist. Disable alarms, hide decoys, or stash escape gear.
  
4. **Execution Phase**: Go for the loot. If you've planned well, you'll walk right in and out. If not, expect heavy resistance.
  
5. **Debrief**: At the end of each mission, you're graded on your performance. Earn in-game currency based on your grade.

### Monetization:

1. **In-Game Currency**: Earn or buy currency to spend on new gadgets, outfits, and special abilities.
  
2. **Time-Boosters**: Purchase a one-time use item that extends a time-loop by a few crucial seconds.
  
3. **Additional Heists**: New heist locations and scenarios available as premium DLC.

### Technical Requirements:

1. **State Management**: Critical for maintaining changes made in each loop.
  
2. **AI Pathfinding**: Guards and other NPCs need to react believably to changes in their environment.
  
3. **Pixel Art Assets**: A variety of building interiors, gadgets, and characters to populate the game world.
  
4. **Sound Design**: Suspenseful music and sound effects to complement the stealthy nature of the game.

### Development Time:

Estimated 6-8 months for a minimal viable product, given the complexity of the time-looping and AI mechanics.
