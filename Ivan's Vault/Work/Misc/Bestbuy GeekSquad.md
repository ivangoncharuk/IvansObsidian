# Interview Questions
## Why do you want to work at Best Buy?

This is your opportunity to tell the employer what attracted you to their company specifically.

> "As a long time customer of Best Buy, I saw that you do more than just sell technology. Your store associates figure out how technology should serve people and fit into their lifestyle. This customer-driven approach is what drew me in to applying at Best Buy."

## Describe a time a customer was unhappy. What did you do to resolve the problem?

Best Buy is all about customer service. Show that you share those values by explaining a time you helped an unsatisfied customer.

> "In my previous position, a customer came in informing me that she was overcharged for a product. After reviewing her receipt, I saw that she was correct. Not only did I refund her change, but I gave her a coupon for 15 percent off her next visit. This solution ensured that she would walk away happy and the business would get a return customer."

## What traits are important on a team?

Working any job, whether retail, food service, etc. you will need to know how to work well with others. Explain what characteristics you find important in a team atmosphere.

> "The two traits I find to be necessities are communication and dependability. Communication plays a large role because everyone needs to be on the same page in order to work well together as a team. Also, we must all be reliable to build trust among the team and be able to count on one another. Without those qualities not much will get done in the most effective manner."

## What would make you a good fit for this position?

Explain to the interviewer how the job description and company culture overlap with your strengths. This is your chance to show what you bring to the table.

> "In my previous position, I worked in a similar field so I'm always up to date with the latest technology, music and movies. I would love to grow my knowledge here because Best Buy is a thought leader in the field of technology. Also, my personality is a perfect fit for the high energy and friendliness that Best Buy represents."
