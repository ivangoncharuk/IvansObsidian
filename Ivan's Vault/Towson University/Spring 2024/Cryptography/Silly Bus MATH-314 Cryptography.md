- **Cryptology**
	- Study of communication securely over insecure channels
- Cryptography
	- Writing (or designing systems to write) messages securely
- Cryptanalysis
	- Study of methods to analyze and break hidden messages
	- What makes a system secure
	- Breaking and cracking a system or key

- Symmetric Key
	- Alice and bob use a pre-shared secret key
- Public key
	- Bob makes an encryption key public that Alice uses to encrypt a message. Only Bob has the decryption key.

### Possible Attacks
- Read Alice's message.
- Find Alice's key to rad all of Alice's messages.
- Corrupt Alice's message, so Bob receive an altered message.
- Pretend to be Alice and communicate with Bob.

### Key Terms
- Confidentiality
	- Only Bob should be able to read Alice's message
- Data integrity
	- Alice's message shouldn't be altered in any way.
- Authentication
	- Bob wants to make sure Alice actually sent the message.
- Non-repudiation
	- Alice cannot claim she didn't send the message.
