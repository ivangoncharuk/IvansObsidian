# Ethical Concepts and Principles for Case Analysis

## 1. Background Concepts (Not Ethical Principles)

### Particularism

> "Moral Particularism, at its most trenchant, is the claim that there are no defensible moral principles, that moral thought does not consist in the application of moral principles to cases, and that the morally perfect person should not be conceived as the person of principle."
> 
> Particularism claims that moral 'rightness' or 'wrongness' of a certain action depends on the specifics or context of the situation rather than universal principles. Moral judgement should be made based on the unique context and details of each case specifically, which emphasizes the variability and context-dependent nature of moral reasoning. Particularism rejects the idea of fixed moral rules that are applicable to all situations, and instead prefers an assessment of the distinctive features of an ethical case. It highlights the importance of individual judgment in a morally complex problem.

### Ethical Pluralism

> "Ethical pluralism (also referred to as value pluralism) is a theory about the nature of the values or goods that human beings pursue, and the pursuit of which make up the substance of their moral lives. Most simply ethical pluralism holds that the values or goods legitimately pursued by human beings are plural, incompatible, and incommensurable."
> 
> Ethical Pluralism claims that there are is no single moral truth for all ethical situations. Instead, it suggests that there are numerous different moral principles and values that are equally valid to any particular case. This principle acknowledges the possibility that different principles apply in different contexts. Ethical pluralism also suggests that conflicts between moral values can be common, resolving them requires consideration of the specifics of each situation, almost similar to particularism. Ethical Pluralism is an approach that values multiple moral frameworks to coexist with one another.

### The Principle of Double Effect

> "The principle of double effect is a normative principle according to which in pursuing the good it is sometimes morally permissible to bring about some evil as a side-effect or merely foreseen consequence: the same evil would not be morally justified as an intended means or end."
> 
> The Principle of Double Effect states that an action that has harmful consequences could be morally permissible as long as the harm was not intended. The harm could have even been foreseen, but as long as the intended outcome is sufficiently 'good' enough that it outweighs the unintended 'bad' negative side effects of an action, this principle suggests that that action could be justified. The principle would often be applied to cases where difficult ethical decisions need to be made like war or medical cases. It highlights the importance of intensions in an ethical judgement and provides a framework of reasoning for evaluating complex moral actions and outcomes.

## 2. Concepts Used as Ethical Principles (With Limitations)
### A. Types of Relativism
#### Individual Relativism

> “there are no universal standards. This means, ethics is simply a reflection of a person’s taste, feelings, and values. In other words, there are no objective moral values but only subjective ones, due to the fact that they are based on a person’s feeling, preferences, and values.”
> 
> Individual Relativism assumes that moral judgements are relative to an individual rather than a universal truth or standard. This perspective suggests that anything that is considered morally 'right' or 'wrong' can vary greatly between multiple people. This is based on an individuals unique experiences, upbringings, beliefs, and values. Individual Relativism seems to challenge the idea of moral truths that are applicable to all, and instead brings attention to the very subjective nature of morality. This concept claims that each person's moral framework is valid within the context of their individual life.

> https://www.bricefoundation.org/single-post/2016/03/18/Individualistic-Moral-Relativism-vs-Cultural-Moral-Relativism

#### Social Relativism

> Social Relativism, on the other hand, grounds moral truths and judgments in the norms and values of a society or culture rather than in individual perspectives or universal standards. This form of relativism suggests that what is considered morally right or wrong is determined by societal consensus, reflecting the collective preferences and beliefs of a community. It recognizes the diversity of moral systems across different societies and argues against the imposition of one society's moral norms on another. Social relativism emphasizes the role of cultural heritage and social context in shaping moral judgments and practices.
> Social Relativism is similar to Individual Relativism but different in which moral truths and judgements hold in the values of a particular society or culture rather than an individual's perspective or a universal standard. This form of relativism suggests that what is morally correct should be determined by the societal consensus. Social Relativism recognizes diversity

#### Historical Relativism


> "Historical relativism extends the concept of relativism across time, arguing that moral truths and standards are bound to specific historical contexts and epochs."
> 
> Historical Relativism takes the approach of relativism across time. It argues that moral and ethical truths are bound to specific historical contexts. This approach suggests that moral judgements and values change and evolve over time. These moral judgements are influenced by cultural and historical conditions over each major time period. It highlights how morality morphs over time, and that what is deemed moral in one time period could differ drastically from another time period. Historical Relativism requires the understanding the historical context of the time when evaluating a specific case.

### B. Other Concepts

#### God as a Moral Authority

> "Justification for this claim derives support from the idea that religious moral codes have origins in divine will: “Morality is whatever God commands.” The theory that identifies the morally right with what God commands is called, unsurprisingly, ‘Divine Command Theory’."
> The concept of God as a moral authority is that moral and ethical standards are established by 'divine command' rooted in God's will. This approach is defined by the term 'Divine Command Theory' or DCT, which suggests that what is morally right is fundamentally what God commands. This provides a framework where morality is in the divine will of God and not subject to human or societal opinions. Critics have challenged this theory with the "Euthyphro dilemma" which questions whether moral actions are correct either because God simply commands that they are right, or if God commands those moral actions because the actions are inherently right. Despite this, proponents of DCT argue that the theory provides a foundation for understanding morality.

#### Natural Law Theory

> "Natural law is a theory that says that human beings possess intrinsic values that govern their reasoning and behavior. Natural law maintains that these rules of right and wrong are inherent in people and are not created by society or court judges." 
> 
> Natural Law Theory suggests that moral and ethical principles is engrained in human nature and discoverable through reason. Right and wrong is not solely determined by any court system or societal norms. The theory suggests that certain rights and wrongs are universal and can be understood by analyzing human nature. Unlike DCT which roots morality in the will of God, Natural Law Theory claims that the rational basis for morality transcends man-made laws and customs and implies that through the use of reason, people can discover the moral truths that exist in reality itself. This theory implies that there is a natural order to the universe.

## 3. Strongest Arguments for Case Analysis

### A. Consequentialism (Utilitarianism)

#### Rule-Consequentialism (Utilitarianism)

> Rule-Consequentialism is a perspective within utilitarianism suggesting that the morality of an action is determined by adherence to a set of rules that, if universally adopted, would result in the best possible outcomes. This approach emphasizes the significance of following pre-established guidelines rather than assessing each action solely by its direct consequences. The concept suggests that a well-structured set of rules can guide individuals toward actions that collectively enhance overall welfare. Critics argue about the flexibility and adaptability of such rules in differing contexts, questioning whether strict adherence might sometimes prevent the achievement of the best outcomes in specific situations. And proponents believe that Rule-Consequentialism strikes a balance between consistent ethical behavior and the pursuit of positive outcomes for the greatest number
> 
> https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism-rule

#### Act-Consequentialism (Utilitarianism)

> Act-Consequentialism argues that the morality of an action depends on the outcomes it produces. Act-Consequentialism evaluates each action on its own merits, considering its immediate consequences, unlike Rule-Consequentialisms' reliance on predefined rules. This approach of utilitarianism allows for greater flexibility, as it assesses the ethical value of actions based on the specific context and the direct impact on overall welfare. Critics point to the potential impracticality of this approach, given the challenge of predicting outcomes accurately. Proponents see it as a means to ensure that actions are always tailored to achieve the best possible results, emphasizing the importance of adaptability in ethical decision making.

> Portmore, D. W. (n.d.). Rule Consequentialism. https://www.public.asu.edu/~dportmor/Rule%20Consequentialism.pdf

#### Long Term Consequentialism (Utilitarianism)

> Long Term Consequentialism is a form of utilitarianism that considers the far-reaching effects of actions, prioritizing outcomes that unfold over a longer period of time. This approach emphasizes the importance of considering the future implications of present actions, aiming to secure long-term benefits for society and future generations. It advocates a broader view that involves the enduring impact of actions, and challenges the focus on immediate outcomes. Critics argue that the long-term focus may sometimes overlook urgent needs or present injustices, while proponents believe it offers a pathway to sustainable ethical decision-making.
> 
> https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-1-4020-9160-5_52

#### Short Term Consequentialism (Utilitarianism)

> Short Term Consequentialism focuses on the immediate consequences of actions, valuing the near-term benefits and harms that result from ethical decisions. This approach aims to address current concerns and immediate impacts, prioritizing quick outcomes over long-term effects. It reflects a pragmatic stance on decision-making, where the urgency of present issues demands prompt and effective responses. While this approach is lauded for its attention to immediate needs, critics suggest it may neglect the broader, long-term consequences of actions, potentially leading to shortsighted ethical choices.

### B. Kantian Ethics – Deontology

#### Categorical Imperative I


> The first formulation of Kant's Categorical Imperative commands that one should act only according to maxims that can be willed to become universal laws. This means your actions should be ones you'd want everyone to follow, in any situation, underscoring the idea that moral principles should apply universally. It's a test of the rationality and morality of our actions, focusing on whether the mottos of our actions could be applied consistently by all rational beings. This formulation emphasizes the logical and universal nature of moral duties, distinguishing them from desires or empirical motivations.
> 
> https://www.britannica.com/topic/categorical-imperative

#### Categorical Imperative II

> The second formulation of the Categorical Imperative stresses the intrinsic value of humanity, insisting that one should act in ways that treat humanity, whether in oneself or in others, always as an end and never merely as a means to an end. This principle underlines the respect and dignity owed to all individuals, advocating for the consideration of others' well-being and autonomy in our moral deliberations. It's a call to recognize and uphold the inherent worth of every person, guiding us towards actions that respect the moral rights and autonomy of others​.
> 
> https://www.britannica.com/topic/categorical-imperative

### C. Rossian Ethics

> Rossian Ethics is built on the idea that there are several basic moral duties we should follow, like keeping promises and not harming others. These duties are called "prima facie" duties because they are not absolute but provide a basis for moral decisions. This theory values a variety of moral principles instead of one single rule for all situations. It's a way of thinking that respects the complexity of real-life moral choices​

> https://www.ipl.org/essay/Ethics-In-Rossian-Ethics-PCQ5S5CNFG

### D. Virtue Ethics

> "Virtue ethics is a broad term for theories that emphasize the role of character and virtue in moral philosophy rather than either doing one's duty or acting in order to bring about good consequences."
> Virtue Ethics emphasizes the role of character and virtues in moral philosophy. It suggests that possessing and practicing virtues like honesty, bravery, and wisdom naturally leads to good actions. The theory posits that moral life is about developing a virtuous character, not just adhering to rules or evaluating consequences.
> 
> https://iep.utm.edu/virtue/

### E. Care Ethics

> Care Ethics emphasizes the importance of interpersonal relationships and the responsibilities that arise from them. It focuses on care and compassion as central ethical values, challenging traditional moral theories that prioritize justice and autonomy. This approach to ethics highlights the moral significance of responding to the needs of others, particularly in contexts of dependency and vulnerability.
> 
> https://iep.utm.edu/care-ethics/

### F. Social Contract Theory

> Social Contract Theory suggests that society and government originate from an agreement among individuals to improve their lives by creating rules and structures for mutual benefit. This theory emphasizes that moral and political obligations are based on the consensual arrangements that people make, prioritizing the collective agreement as the foundation of societal norms and laws.

### G. Justice (Related to Fairness)

#### Distributive Justice

> Distributive justice focuses on the fairness of how resources and burdens are spread across society. It operates on the principle that resource allocations should reflect an individuals' contributions and needs, aiming for a balance that respects everyone's rights without presuming a singular idea of what makes life good. Critics sometimes argue that focusing on distributive justice can lead to inaction due to disagreements on what constitutes fairness. But ignoring it means implicitly endorsing the status quo, making a strong case for why it's crucial in discussions on economic policy and societal welfare​.
> 
> https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justice-distributive/​

#### Comparative Justice

> While the concept of comparative justice wasn't directly discussed in the sources, it generally focuses on ensuring individuals in similar situations receive similar treatment. It's about fairness and consistency in application, whether in legal judgments or resource distribution. This principle is vital for maintaining trust in systems of justice and governance, ensuring that like cases are handled alike, without arbitrary discrimination or favoritism.

#### Punitive Justice

> Punitive justice, or corrective justice, focuses on righting the wrongs through fair and proportionate punishment. It's deeply concerned with accountability, aiming to ensure that individuals who commit wrongs face consequences that not only match the severity of their actions but also promote their moral improvement. The goal is not just to punish for punishment's sake but to restore a sense of justice and balance within society, deterring future offenses and potentially rehabilitating the wrongdoer. This form of justice emphasizes the importance of a legal and moral framework that supports both the individual's and society's growth towards a more just and orderly community.

### H. Rights Based

#### Natural Rights (Problematic)

> Natural rights are considered foundational rights that every individual inherently possesses by virtue of being human. These rights are not granted by governments or laws but are believed to be universal and inalienable. However, the concept of natural rights is contentious. Critics argue against its historical and philosophical basis. For example, Jeremy Bentham, a critic, described the idea of natural rights as "nonsense upon stilts." He argued that rights are created by laws and governments, challenging the idea that rights exist independently of societal structures. This perspective is touchy within philosphical debates, and people should be cautious when using the term "natural rights" due to its complex and problematic implications​.
> 
> https://iep.utm.edu/jeremy-bentham

#### Legal Rights

> Legal rights are specific rights granted to individuals by laws and the legal system. Unlike natural rights, which are considered inherent, legal rights are established and regulated by the legal framework of a particular society. These rights can vary widely between different legal systems and can be modified, repealed, or expanded through legislative processes. The concept of legal rights stresses the role of governmental and legal institutions in defining and protecting the rights of individuals within a society​.
> 
> https://iep.utm.edu/jeremy-bentham​


#### Positive Rights

> Positive rights refer to the rights that require action from others, including the government, to be fulfilled. These rights often involve entitlements to certain services or resources, such as the right to education, healthcare, or social security. Positive rights emphasize the responsibility of the government and society to provide the conditions necessary for individuals to enjoy these rights. The implementation of positive rights can lead to debates about the extent of government intervention and the allocation of resources necessary to fulfill these obligations​.
> 
> https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rights/



#### Negative Rights

>Negative rights are rights that require others, including the government, to refrain from interfering in certain activities of the individual. These rights, such as the right to free speech, the right to privacy, and the right to own property, demand non-interference rather than active provision. Negative rights are foundational to the concept of liberty, emphasizing an individual's freedom from external constraints. The balance between negative rights and the needs of the wider community can lead to discussions on the limitations of these rights in certain contexts.
