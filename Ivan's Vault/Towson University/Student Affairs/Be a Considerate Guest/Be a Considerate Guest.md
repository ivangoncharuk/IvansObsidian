### Be On Time

The chapter emphasizes the importance of respecting both the time of arrival and departure when you're a guest. In your case, this is relevant to not only your girlfriend, who is directly hosting you, but also to the dorm building and by extension, Towson University, which has its own set of guidelines and codes of conduct. Here, the security guard acts as an intermediary between you and the institution, upholding its rules and ensuring that all guests respect the community's standards. By being on time and following the set guidelines, you're showing respect to your girlfriend, the university, and the security personnel tasked with maintaining a safe and orderly environment.

### No Surprise Guests

The chapter advises against bringing surprise guests. This aligns with the university's rules of not allowing unauthorized guests into dorm buildings, which is a standard the security guard is required to enforce. By adhering to this, you're helping to maintain the security and integrity of the residential community.

### Never Force an Invitation

Forcing an invitation goes against the etiquette of being a good guest. This implies that you should only be in the building if you're invited by a resident, which aligns with what the security personnel are instructed to ensure.

### Keep a Pleasant Disposition

Perhaps the most pertinent point here is to "keep a pleasant disposition." In your specific case, the apparent rudeness noted in the elevator could be viewed as a failure to maintain this disposition. Security personnel are part of the extended host network of the university. By showing appreciation for the efforts of those who are charged with maintaining a safe and pleasant environment, you contribute to the overall well-being of the community.

### Additional Points

While the other points about leaving a phone number and specific considerations for hotel guests may not directly apply to your situation, they still underline the same fundamental principle of respect and consideration.

### The Security Guard's Role

The security guard at the front desk has a duty and responsibility to uphold the rules and ensure that everyone in the building is authorized to be there. Their role is not just about ensuring physical security but also about maintaining a social environment where everyone can live and work in harmony. Your adherence to the guidelines for being a good guest is not just an act of respect toward your girlfriend but also toward the community and the personnel tasked with safeguarding it.

In summary, the etiquette of being a good guest isn't just a set of arbitrary rules but rather a codification of mutual respect and consideration. Both guests and hosts have roles to play in this social contract, as do those like the security guard who serve as gatekeepers to these shared spaces. By understanding and abiding by these social norms, you're participating in the broader community in a positive and respectful manner.
