#choosing_civility_paper 

- Briefly introduce the situation (the [[Sticker Incident]], the security personnel, and the resulting report).
- State the purpose of the paper: to explore the concept of civility and its impact on your life and the Towson University community.

The purpose of this paper relates to an event that transpired during the spring semester of 2023. I was invited to my friend's dorm, and, following standard procedure, I presented my TU one card as requested. The card in question had a TU dorm building specific sticker on it. Unaware of any kind of policy regarding decorating my one card, I had attached this sticker to my card due to its sentimental value—it represented Paca House, a building name that no longer exists on campus but holds historical significance for me. The sticker was a gift from an old friend and is tied to a traumatic event that still carries significant weight in my life. The CCA noticed the sticker and informed me that it violated university policy. I was asked to remove it, and I complied, albeit reluctantly. As I proceeded to the elevator, I vocalized my frustration, which was subsequently reported as rude and disrespectful. Though the event occurred several months ago and the scope of my frustration are not fully clear in memory, I want to emphasize that it was aimed at the situation itself, not at the CCA doing their job. Nonetheless, this led to a formal report being filed against me.

This incident, along with the requirement to read and write this paper, prompted me to reflect on my actions—an event that seemed trivial at the time. Through my research, I have learned about the concepts of civility and accountability, which are foundational to the TU community. This paper aims to explore these principles, drawing on selected chapters from the [[Choosing Civility - The Twenty-Five Rules of Considerate Conduct]] by Forni, P. M. and referencing the university's [[Tiger Pledge]], as I consider the implications of my actions and contemplate my future behavior within the TU community.
