#choosing_civility_paper

The purpose of this paper relates to an event that transpired during the spring semester of 2023. I was invited to my friend's dorm, and, following standard procedure, I presented my TU one card as requested. The card in question had a TU dorm building specific sticker on it. Unaware of any kind of policy regarding decorating my one card, I had attached this sticker to my card due to its sentimental value—it represented “PH” for Paca House, a dorm building located in West Village. It is a building name that no longer exists on campus but holds historical significance for me. The sticker was a gift from an old friend and is tied to a traumatic event that still carries significant weight in my life. The CCA noticed the sticker and informed me that it violated university policy. I was asked to remove it, and I complied, albeit reluctantly. As I proceeded to the elevator, I vocalized my frustration, which was subsequently reported as rude and disrespectful. Though the event occurred several months ago, and I don't remember much of what happened, I want to emphasize that it was aimed at the situation itself, not at the CCA doing their job. Nonetheless, this led to a formal report being filed against me.

This incident, along with the requirement to read and write this paper, prompted me to reflect on my actions—an event that seemed trivial at the time. Through my research, I have learned about the concepts of civility and accountability, which are foundational to the TU community. This paper aims to explore these principles, drawing on selected chapters from the _Choosing Civility - The Twenty-Five Rules of Considerate Conduct_ by Forni, P. M. and referencing the university's Tiger Pledge, as I consider the implications of my actions and contemplate my future behavior within the TU community.

My readings have led me to appreciate that civility isn't simply about adhering to social norms or how one projects themselves in a social setting. It serves as the adhesive that binds communities, including Towson University. As described by Forni in his book, civility involves a range of respectful behaviors. One must yield with grace in debates, acknowledging the merit in another person's argument without becoming hostile. This serves as a mark of maturity and garners respect. Civility also involves responding carefully to challenges to prevent escalating conflict, which helps maintain a harmonious environment. Finally, it calls for the acknowledgment of one's own mistakes, demonstrating humility and a willingness to grow (Forni, 2002).

During my recent incident with the CCA, some of these tenets were notably absent. By making unsolicited comments in the elevator, I undermined the mutual respect and maturity that should ideally characterize my interactions within the TU community. My failure to restrain any rude comments escalated a situation that could have passed peacefully. Though my recollection of the event is spotty, I accept that I was most likely at fault and commit to amending my behavior.

My actions in the elevator ruined the atmosphere for everyone else. This reminds me of a quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson, who said, "Manners are the happy way of doing things" (Emerson, n.d.). He's basically telling us that when you have good manners, it makes everything more pleasant for everyone around you. Another interesting point comes from the etymology of the word "manners." It's derived from the Latin word "manus," meaning "hand" (Forni, 2002). This implies that manners are all about how you 'handle' situations and people in your life. My behavior in the elevator was like handling a delicate situation with clumsy hands. In simpler terms, I created a negative vibe for everyone in that space. Emerson and Forni make it clear that manners is about setting the tone for positive and respectful interactions (Forni, 2002).

Forni profoundly stated that "Being civil to one another is much more active and positive good than mere politeness or courtesy... it is not the sort of thing that can be 'demanded' as a matter of duty, like a moral entitlement" (Forni, 2002). This interpretation elevates civility from simple polite gestures to proactive acts that contribute to societal and relational well-being. It stresses that civility is about creating a supportive, harmonious community and not just avoiding confrontation.

But the concept of civility also extends into the broader responsibilities we bear as citizens and neighbors. This notion aligns perfectly with the TU Tiger Pledge, which emphasizes not only the need for personal respect but also for collective good. It includes commitments like "I will respect myself and others" and "I will be accountable for my actions" (Towson University, n.d.). The pledge reinforces that the true essence of civility goes beyond mere politeness to include a collective ethical code.

My actions in that elevator failed not just to meet the principles of civility but also broke faith with the Tiger Pledge’s commitments. In doing so, I fell short of the communal values that we as TU community members have pledged to uphold. My future actions will strive to bridge this gap, fully embracing both the complexities of civility and the straightforward ethics of the Tiger Pledge.

This incident serves as a reminder that failing in one aspect often leads to falling short in others as well. My actions failed to align with the core values outlined in the Tiger Pledge, specifically those of respecting others, acting with integrity, and being accountable for my actions. I showed disrespect to the CCA and this undermined the values of Towson University as a whole. Thinking back on the situation, I recall my friend who invited me, reprimanding me about it, telling me that they can still hear me in the elevator as we were going up. I never thought much of it at the time, and so I failed to see how that might have affected the CCA's mood. In hindsight, I wouldn't expect a good member of the TU community treating their staff like I have, and so I apologize greatly. My comments were rightly deemed inappropriate and failed to meet the ethical standards that are expected of all members of the Towson community.

I didn't handle the administrative aspects of this situation responsibly, either. I neglected the hold on my account and didn't inquire about receiving the resolution letter in a timely manner. This oversight is yet another way I failed to be accountable. Also, I now can understand that my decorated one-card could be even viewed as a risk from a security standpoint, and I see the gravity of the situation. Moving forward, I am committed to better aligning my actions with the values laid out in the Tiger Pledge.

Based on what I've learned about civility and the Tiger Pledge, I've figured out some steps I can take to be a better member of the Towson University community. First, I need to watch what I say, especially when talking to members of the TU staff. Another thing is making sure I know the policies of where I'm going. The book talks about being on time to show respect not just to the person you're visiting, but also to the institution and its rules (Forni, 2002). In the university setting, front desk security help keep everything in order. So, by being on time and following the rules, such as showing the proper identification without any unnecessary stickers. I need to show respect to everyone involved, from my friends to the guards to the university itself.

Keeping a good attitude is also key. My bad behavior in the elevator wasn't just rude to the CCA but it was also disrespectful to the TU community. Just like the book points out, everyone from the front desk security to students plays a part in making a community safe and welcoming (Forni, 2002). So, treating people nicely is about making the whole place better for everyone.

I also need to take responsibility for my actions. Ignoring the hold on my account for this long was a mistake. From now on, I'll deal with important alerts to my education like that right away. This is in line with the Tiger Pledge, which stresses the importance of being accountable for what you do. These steps aren't just about staying out of trouble. They're about making TU a better place for everyone, by sticking to the rules and policies and treating everyone with respect.

In conclusion, I realize that civility is the foundation for building a community that thrives on mutual respect and accountability. My incident with the CCA was more than just a personal misstep. It was a violation of the larger social contract that binds all of us at TU. By speaking out of frustration in that elevator, I strayed from the core tenets of the Tiger Pledge—respecting others and being accountable for my actions.

Taking a step back to reflect on the incident and delve into the principles of civility, I've gained valuable insights from Forni's work. Respecting other people's time, following established rules, and maintaining a positive attitude are all essential aspects of being a good citizen in any community, including TU (Forni, 2002). These aren't just rules on paper; they're commitments we make to each other to ensure that the campus remains a place where everyone can learn, grow, and feel secure.

I’m committed to being more conscious of my behavior moving forward. Whether it’s by watching what I say, understanding and following the policies of the places I visit, or just treating everyone with the respect they deserve, I plan to fully embody the spirit of the Tiger Pledge in my day-to-day actions.
