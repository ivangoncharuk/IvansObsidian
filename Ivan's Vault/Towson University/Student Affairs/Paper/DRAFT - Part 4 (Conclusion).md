- Summarize key points.
- Reiterate your commitment to understanding and practicing civility in the future.

In conclusion, I realize that civility isn't just about being polite; it's the foundation for building a community that thrives on mutual respect and accountability. My incident with the CCA was more than just a personal misstep. It was a violation of the larger social contract that binds all of us at TU. By speaking out of frustration in that elevator, I strayed from the core tenets of the Tiger Pledge—respecting others and being accountable for my actions.

Taking a step back to reflect on the incident and delve into the principles of civility, I've gained valuable insights from Forni's work. Respecting other people's time, following established rules, and maintaining a positive attitude are all essential aspects of being a good citizen in any community, including TU (Forni, 2002). These aren't just rules on paper; they're commitments we make to each other to ensure that the campus remains a place where everyone can learn, grow, and feel secure.

I’m committed to being more conscious of my behavior moving forward. Whether it’s by watching what I say, understanding and following the policies of the places I visit, or just treating everyone with the respect they deserve, I plan to fully embody the spirit of the Tiger Pledge in my day-to-day actions.

So, as much as this process has been about accountability, it has also been an educational journey. I am eager to apply what I've learned, not just to avoid further incidents but to positively contribute to the TU community that I am proud to be a part of.
