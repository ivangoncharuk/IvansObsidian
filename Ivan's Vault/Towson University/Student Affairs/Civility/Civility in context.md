This is a university situation where my actions have been called into question, and I have been given the task of writing a [[PAPER - Choosing Civility]] on civility and being a good guest. 

In the book you're consulting, civility isn't just about saying "please" and "thank you." 

According to philosopher Robert B. Pippin, civility is an "active and positive good" that can't be demanded but should be freely given. It's about building a better community by being not just polite, but genuinely considerate and respectful. 

[[Civility]] has its roots in the Latin word _civitas_, which is related to being a good citizen in a city. Just as cities are melting pots where people learn to live together, dorm buildings at a university are microcosms of society where students learn to coexist with people from different backgrounds.

In your situation, the dorm security woman enforced a rule about stickers on ID cards. Even if the rule felt unfair or unnecessary to you, especially since the stickers had sentimental value, the essence of civility suggests that the ideal response would have been to handle the situation with **grace and understanding**. [[Civility]], in this context, is a two-way street. While the rule may seem minor or even pointless to me, it could be essential for security or administrative reasons you're not aware of. In a communal living situation like a dorm, rules often exist to create a stable, secure environment for everyone. By reacting with apparent rudeness, I disrupted that atmosphere, briefly.

- Writing this paper gives you a chance to reflect not only on your own actions but on the larger question of what it means to be a part of a community.

- Being a good guest could be framed as being a temporary member of a community. Just as civility involves contributing to the general well-being of a community, being a good guest involves respecting the norms and expectations of the place you're visiting, **even if I don't fully understand or agree with them.** It’s about treating my temporary home with the same care and respect that I’d want from guests in my own home.

In sum, my experience can serve as a life lesson. It’s a crash course in civility, a complex yet invaluable social virtue that goes far beyond saying the right things to also doing the right things, for the betterment of everyone involved.
