Quote by Jean de La Bruyere
> "The essence of politeness seems to be to take care of that by our words and actions we make other people pleased with us as well as with themselves."

From the book (page 10-11)
> To understand politeness we must think of the word *polish*. The polite are those who have *polished* their behavior. They have put some effort into bettering themselves, but they are sometimes looked upon with suspicion. Expressions, such as [[Polite Reply]], [[Polite Lie]], and [[Polite Applause]] connect politeness to hypocrisy. 

The terms "Polite Lie," "Polite Reply," and "Polite Applause" evoke the complex nature of politeness, which can sometimes overlap with civility but is not entirely the same thing. Each term raises questions about sincerity, social norms, and the often delicate balance between honesty and kindness.

> It is true that the polite are so inclined to view their own feelings to spare someone else's. Self-serving lying, however, is always beyond the pale of politeness. If politeness is a quality of character (alongside courtesy good manners and civility), it cannot become a flaw. A suave manipulator may appear to be polite but is not


The quote by Jean de La Bruyere encapsulates the core of politeness as a conscious effort to make others feel good about themselves and about interacting with us. Each element in the quote and the accompanying text from the book offers unique insights into the nature of politeness:

1. **The Essence of Politeness**: According to La Bruyere, the core of being polite is to ensure that our actions and words make people pleased, both with themselves and with us. This emphasizes a reciprocal relationship in social interactions, <u>suggesting that being polite isn't just about adhering to a set of rules but also about creating an emotional atmosphere that is uplifting for everyone involved.</u>
3. **Connection to 'Polish'**: The book suggests that the root word "polish" in "politeness" is telling. Just like you polish a piece of furniture to remove rough edges and make it more pleasing to the eye, being polite is about refining one's behavior. It requires effort and intention to make interactions smoother and more agreeable.
3. **Suspicion and Hypocrisy**: The book acknowledges that politeness can sometimes be associated with fakeness or hypocrisy, like in the terms "Polite Reply," "Polite Lie," and "Polite Applause." These expressions capture the skepticism some people have about the genuine nature of polite behavior. However, the book argues that true politeness isn't about lying to serve oneself; it's about tactfully handling situations to avoid causing harm or discomfort to others.
4. **Quality of Character**: The text states that if politeness is alongside courtesy, good manners, and civility as a quality of character, then it cannot be a flaw. This means that being genuinely polite isn't a mask one puts on but an intrinsic part of one's character that aligns with other virtuous traits.
5. **Distinction from Manipulation**: The text differentiates between a "suave manipulator" and a truly polite person. While a manipulator might appear polite, they're not guided by the genuine desire to make others feel good but rather by self-serving motives. In contrast, true politeness is devoid of deceit and manipulation; it's an honest effort to create a positive atmosphere.
In summary, both La Bruyere's quote and the book's explanation shed light on politeness as a complex but rewarding quality. Itâ€™s not just about following social etiquette but about making a deliberate effort to elevate the emotional well-being of others. Although sometimes misunderstood as mere formality or even deceit, true politeness is an essential part of a virtuous character. It's a conscious act of "polishing" one's behavior to make interactions more pleasant for everyone involved.
