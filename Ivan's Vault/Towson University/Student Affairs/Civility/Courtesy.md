>  In life courtesy and self possession, and in the arts style are the sensible impressions of the free mind, for both arise out of a deliberate shaping of all things and from never being swept away, whatever the emotion, it to confusion or dullness. - William Bustler Yeats

## terms
- "*courtesy*" and 
- "*self-possession*." 


According to Yeats, these qualities are "sensible impressions of the free mind,"meaning they reflect a conscious choice and the freedom to behave in a particular way. 
The qualities arise "out of a deliberate shaping of all things," indicating that they come from purposeful action rather than mere happenstance. Furthermore, Yeats mentions that these qualities are maintained even in the face of strong emotions, ensuring that one is not "swept away" into "confusion or dullness."

Breaking it down:
1. **Courtesy**: The passage connects the term "`court`esy" to the idea of "`court`," suggesting a historical context where courtesy was expected behavior among those in the presence of royalty. In the past, to be "courteous" meant to demonstrate qualities akin to a courtier: 
	1. excellence, 
	2. elegance, 
	3. and respectful **attention**. 
2. The passage suggests that even though the royal court setting is largely outdated, the essence of "courtesy" continues to imply a certain level of **respect and dignity**.
3. **Self-Possession**: This term can be understood as emotional control or composure. Yeats suggests that self-possession is like an art form, requiring mastery and deliberate intent. Having self-possession means you don't let your emotions sweep you away into "confusion or dullness," thereby maintaining your dignity and focus.
3. **In the Arts, Style**: Yeats extends the idea of civility into the realm of arts through the concept of 'style.' Here, 'style' isn't about mere appearance but about a form of expression that emanates from a "free mind." It's an intentional and considered approach to one's craft or communication, parallel to the deliberate shaping of one's behavior in social contexts.
4. **The Free Mind**: Both courtesy and self-possession are highlighted as emanating from a "free mind." This suggests that these are not forced behaviors but choices one makes consciously. It also indicates a level of emotional and intellectual freedom, allowing one to navigate social situations and artistic endeavors with a sense of intentionality and grace.
5. **Deliberate Shaping**: Both in life and arts, courtesy and self-possession are not accidents but are intentionally cultivated qualities. They come from a 'deliberate shaping of all things,' which means you consciously decide to act in a certain way, shaping your behavior, your art, and by extension, your life.

So, when talking about choosing [[Civility]], this quote aligns closely with the idea that being civil is a deliberate choice we make to bring into our interactions:
- excellence, 
- respect, 
- and self-control 
It's a sign of a mature, free mind capable of making thoughtful decisions in both social and artistic settings. [[Civility]] is not a remnant of old-world etiquette but an enduring principle that continues to add value and grace to modern life.
