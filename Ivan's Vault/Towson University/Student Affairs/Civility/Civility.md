## What is Civility?
> "To be fully human you must be able to imagine others hurt and to relate it to the hurt we would experience if we were in their place in consideration is imagination on a moral track"

[[Examples of being civil]]
Good examples to my situation:
- **Yielding with grace when losing an argument**: Acknowledging the validity of another's point without hostility is a sign of maturity and respect for the process of healthy debate.
- **Responding with restraint to a challenge**: This demonstrates emotional intelligence and maturity. By not allowing situations to escalate into conflict, you maintain a respectful environment.
- **Acknowledging your own mistakes**: Admitting fault shows humility and the willingness to correct oneself, which are vital aspects of being civil.


- Form of goodness or gracious goodness.
- well-being of our communities
- health of the planet

## Civility - From the book
(page 11-12)
	Quote by Robert B. Pippin
> Being civil to one another is much more active and positive good then mere politeness or courtesy, but like many other important goods, such as generosity, gratitude, or solidarity, it is not the sort of thing that can be "demanded" as a matter of duty, like a moral entitlement.

How does this chapter and concept of "Civility" relate to the [[Sticker Incident]]?
[[Civility in context]]


Book passage:
> Civility's defining characteristic is its ties to city and society. The word derives from the Latin *civitas*, which means "city", especially in the sense of a civic community. *Civitas* is the same word from which *civilization* comes. The age-old assumption behind civility is that life in the city at has a civilizing effect. City is where we enlighten our intellect and refine our social skills. And as we are shaped by the city, we learn to give of ourselves for the sake of the city. Although we can describe the civil as courteous, polite, and well mannered, etymology reminds us that they are also supposed to be good citizens and good neighbors.

 The quote by Robert B. Pippin and the accompanying passage from the book offer a nuanced view of civility, distinguishing it from politeness and courtesy while also tying it to the larger community and our roles within it. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

1. **Active and Positive Good**: Pippin describes civility as an "active and positive good," indicating that it goes beyond mere polite gestures. It requires intentional actions that contribute to the betterment of society and individual relationships. It's not just about avoiding conflict but about fostering a harmonious and supportive environment.
    
2. **Not a Moral Entitlement**: Pippin notes that civility is not something that can be "demanded as a matter of duty" or considered a "moral entitlement." This suggests that civility is voluntary and arises from individual goodwill rather than being enforced by rules or societal expectations. It's akin to virtues like "generosity, gratitude, or solidarity," which also cannot be demanded but make society better when they are freely given.
    
3. **Ties to City and Society**: The book explains that the term "civility" is derived from the Latin word _civitas_, which refers to a city or civic community. This ties civility to the idea of community life and suggests that living within a community has a "civilizing" effect on individuals.
    
4. **Civilizing Effect of City Life**: According to the book, the essence of civility stems from the transformative power of living in a city. Cities serve as melting pots of intellectual and social growth, making them the places where we "enlighten our intellect and refine our social skills."
    
5. **Citizenship and Neighborliness**: The etymology of the word serves as a reminder that civility is not just about being polite but also about being a good citizen and neighbor. This elevates the concept from individual interactions to a community level, emphasizing that civility is tied to a sense of collective responsibility and mutual respect.
    
6. **Giving of Ourselves**: The book says that as we are shaped by the city, we learn to give of ourselves for its sake. This point stresses that civility is not merely a self-centered endeavor but involves contributing to the well-being of the larger community. It's a reciprocal relationship: the city shapes us, and we, in turn, contribute to its betterment.
    

In summary, the quote and book passage collectively enrich our understanding of civility by positioning it as an active virtue that involves both personal conduct and a commitment to the community. It's not just about polite behavior; it's a more comprehensive ethic that involves being a good citizen and neighbor, contributing to the collective good, and doing so not because it's a duty but because it's a freely chosen virtue.
