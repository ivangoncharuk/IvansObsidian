# Chapter 1
First part of the chapter starts with a passage by novelist Peter Gadol, and it talks about how our modern world is full of untrustworthy leaders and people are losing their vision and moral compass. 
> "We don't dare to think too far ahead, we can't see too far ahead...Where do we find the courage to do what is right? (page 3)

The author wants to bring the message, by reading this book, to agree that 
> "a crucial measure of our success in life is the way we treat one another every day of our lives. (page 4)

It seems the authors intent in this book is to educate society on how to properly behave with one another and define it under the term *civility*.
Mentions the four noble truths "Life is suffering", the author likes this statement. He says that the fact that life is difficult, people recognizing that fact makes life more bearable.
	>"Millions of pages would not have been written if life were not difficult and we didn't need help coping with his challenges" (page 5)
**Every page of this book is imbued with the simple conviction that life is what our relationships make it**
Good relationships make our lives good; bad relationships do the opposite.
> To learn how to be happy we must learn how to live well with others, and civility is a key to that.
