Quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson
> There is always a best way of doing everything, if it be to boil an egg. Manners are the happy way of doing things; each once a stroke of genius or of love, no repeated and hardened into usage.

From the book:

> One think of good manners we often think of children being taught to say "please" and "thank you" and chew with their mouth closed. This may prevent us from looking at manners with the attention they deserve. `Manner` comes from `manus`, the Latin word for "hand". `Manner` and `manners` have to do with the use of our **hands**. A manner is the way something is done, a mode of handling. Thus *manners*, came to refer to behavior in social interaction--the way we handle the encounter between Self and Other. We have good manners when we use our hands well--when we handle others with care. When we rediscover the connection of manner with hand, the hand that, depending on our will and sensitivity, can strike or lift, hurt or soothe, destroy or heal, we understand the importance--for children and adults alike--of having good manners.

The quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson emphasizes that there is an optimal, or "happy," way of doing things, and this extends to our manners. The accompanying text from the book adds another layer of meaning to this, explaining that the term "manners" is rooted in the Latin word for "hands" (`manus`) and refers to how we "handle" interactions between ourselves and others. Here’s a breakdown:

1. **Best Way of Doing Things**: Emerson’s notion that there's a "best way of doing everything" suggests that actions, even as mundane as boiling an egg, can be executed with a form of mastery or finesse. This parallels the idea that manners are not just rules but the 'best ways' of interacting socially—each originally inspired by "a stroke of genius or of love."
    
2. **Manners as the 'Happy Way'**: Emerson refers to manners as the "happy way of doing things," indicating that good manners create a positive environment. They’re not just about rigid etiquette but about creating an atmosphere that is enjoyable and uplifting for everyone involved.
    
3. **From Manus to Manners**: The book points out that the term "manners" is derived from the Latin word "manus," which means hand. This etymology emphasizes that manners are fundamentally about how we "handle" or "touch" the world and the people in it—either metaphorically or literally.
    
4. **Preconceptions about Manners**: The book notes that our ideas about manners are often simplistic, linked to childhood lessons about saying "please" and "thank you." This simplistic view might prevent us from appreciating the complexity and importance of manners in adult life.
    
5. **Handling Others with Care**: The notion that good manners equate to using our "hands" well underscores that manners are about treating others with care and consideration. This is not just about avoiding harm but actively contributing to others’ well-being.
    
6. **The Dual Nature of Hands**: The text concludes by emphasizing the potent symbolism of hands—they can "strike or lift, hurt or soothe, destroy or heal." Rediscovering this symbolic link helps us grasp why manners are essential; they determine whether our impact on others is negative or positive, harmful or healing.
    
7. **Importance for All Ages**: The text emphasizes that manners aren't just for children; they are crucial for adults as well. Recognizing the symbolism and depth of what manners mean helps us understand their continued relevance in our lives.
    

In essence, both Emerson's quote and the book’s elaboration make a compelling case for manners as not just superficial social norms but as deeply considered actions. These actions have the power to transform social interactions into respectful and caring encounters, thereby reflecting the 'best' or 'happy' ways of handling ourselves and others.
