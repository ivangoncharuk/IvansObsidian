Good evening,  
  
This is my submission for the #homework introductory email assignment for my Software Engineering course. My name is Ivan Goncharuk, and I'm excited to be a part of your software engineering course this semester. I am majoring in Computer Science with no specific concentration. I am originally from Uzbekistan and I'm currently residing in Dundalk. As for my occupation, I am currently working as a food delivery driver with Uber while seeking opportunities in IT. I am also actively preparing for my CompTIA SY0-601 exam .  

- My contact number is 410-703-0807,Â 
- and you can reach me at igonch1@students.towson.edu
- or goncharukivan.biz@gmail.com

What interests me most about this course is the prospect of improving my project management skills. I have a number of unfinished projects across various domains, from game development to iOS and web apps, and I'm eager to learn how to take them from conception to completion. Additionally, I am looking for mentorship opportunities to grow my career in IT and/or software development. Outside of my professional interests, I enjoy music production and play both the drums and the saxophone in my free time.

  

I look forward to a rewarding semester and thank you in advance for your guidance and expertise.

  

Best regards,

Ivan Goncharuk
