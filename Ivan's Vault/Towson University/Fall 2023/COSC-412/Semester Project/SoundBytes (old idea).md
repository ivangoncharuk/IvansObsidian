# SoundBytes
***The Social Media Platform for Audio Content***

> NOTE: THIS GOT REPLACED BY [[SoundFusion AI Idea]]

---
### Basic Idea

By integrating both social media and AI components, SoundBytes could offer a unique, engaging experience that goes beyond traditional audio sharing platforms.

---
### Core Features

1.	**Sound Byte Uploads**: Users can upload short audio clipsâ€”music samples, spoken word, ambient sounds, etc.
2.	**Public and Private Feeds**: Users can share sound bytes either publicly or within a selected circle of friends.
3.	**Tagging and Categories**: Users tag their uploads with descriptors like #*music*, #*spokenword*, or #*ambient*, facilitating easy search and discovery.
4.	**Comments and Reactions**: Users can comment on and react to sound bytes, enhancing community engagement.

---
### Database integration

- Stores the user profiles, 
- sound byte metadata, 
- comments, 
- reactions, 
- and tags.

---

### (possible) AI-Enhanced Features

1.	**Sound Byte Recommender**: ChatGPT interacts with users to gauge their mood or interests and recommends sound bytes from the database accordingly.
2.	**Automated Tagging**: AI analyzes the audio to auto-tag sound bytes with accurate descriptors. For example, if it detects guitar strumming, it auto-tags it as #*guitar*.
3.	**Trending Analysis**: Use AI to analyze which sound bytes are trending based on various metrics, offering real-time insights to users.

---

4.	**Sentiment Analysis on Comments**: The ChatGPT API can be used to analyze comments for sentiment, helping to moderate toxic content or highlight exceptionally positive feedback.
5.	**Collaboration Proposer**: The AI can suggest potential collaborations between users based on their upload history and preferences.
6.	**Auto-Mastering**: An AI-powered tool that automatically masters uploaded sound bytes to enhance their audio quality.
7.	**Voice-to-Text Summaries**: For spoken word sound bytes, AI could generate short textual summaries or transcripts, making them more searchable.

---
### Monetization

1.	**Premium Features**: Offer a paid subscription for features like unlimited uploads, advanced analytics, and AI-enhanced mastering.
2.	**Marketplace**: Integrate a marketplace for buying/selling/licensing sound bytes.
3.	**Ads**: Implement targeted advertising based on user interests and activities.

### Possible Tech Stack
---
#### Backend:

1. **Node.js** with **Express**: For creating a scalable RESTful API.
2. **PostgreSQL**: Robust and open-source relational database for storing user data, sound byte metadata, comments, and tags.
3. **AWS S3**: To store the sound bytes.
---
#### Frontend:

1. **React**: For a dynamic and interactive UI.
2. **Redux**: For state management.
3. **React-Router**: For client-side routing.
---
#### Audio Processing:

**Web Audio API**: For basic playback features.

*possibly will need an upgrade*

---
#### Authentication

**JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For stateless, secure authentication.

(I would like to use something else) #todo

---
#### Deployment

1. **Docker**: For containerization.
2. **AWS EC2**: For scalable cloud hosting.
---
#### Additional Tools

1. **Git, GitHub**: Version control.
2. **Nginx**: Reverse proxy.

---
### Development Phases
---

**Phase 1 - [[MVP (Minimum Viable Product)]]**
   - Focus on the essential features listed above to get the platform up and running.
---
**Phase 2 - Refinement**
   - Optimize for mobile.
   - Introduce pagination or infinite scroll for the public feed.
---
**Phase 3 - AI Integration**
   - Once the platform is stable, start integrating OpenAI and other AI features like automated tagging and recommendations.
---
Once the MVP is functional, we can start adding more complex features like AI integration, additional search filters, or premium subscriptions.

---
### Safety and Moderation Features

---

**Karma System**

Implementing a Karma or reputation system could be beneficial for encouraging quality contributions and discouraging spam or harmful content. Users with higher Karma could have privileges like increased visibility or access to special features.

---

**Content Moderation**

To prevent disturbing or damaging sounds, you'd need a robust moderation system. 

This could include...

---

- **User Reporting**: Allow users to report harmful content, which can then be reviewed by a moderation team.

- **AI Moderation**: Employ machine learning algorithms to scan and flag potentially harmful audio content based on features like frequency and volume spikes. You could also implement sentiment analysis on comments to identify instances where users found content disturbing.
---
- **Safe Mode**: Offer a 'Safe Mode' filter that screens out content flagged as potentially harmful, giving users the option to listen in a safer environment.

- **Community Guidelines**: Clearly define what is and isn't allowed, and enforce these guidelines rigorously.
