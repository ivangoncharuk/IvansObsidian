## Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)

### Definition
- The Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) is a tree representation of the abstract syntactic structure of source code. It abstracts away certain details that are handled during lexical analysis, such as parentheses and semicolons.

> An Abstract Syntax Tree provides a high-level representation of a program's structure, facilitating easier analysis, transformations, and optimizations. In the context of implementing your mini-language in Emacs Lisp, constructing and manipulating an AST will likely be a key step.

### Importance
- Simplifies the program's structure to make it easier to analyze and manipulate.
- Used in various phases of a [[Compilers]] or interpreter, such as semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation.
  
### Nodes
- Each node in the AST represents a construct in the language. 
  - E.g., expressions, statements, loops, conditionals, etc.
  
### Construction
- Usually constructed as part of a "parsing" step, which follows lexical analysis in a compiler/interpreter pipeline.

### Example with Given Snippet
Consider the given code snippet:
```java
while x < 10 do
	x := x - 1
```

A simplified AST could look like:
```
    WhileLoop
    /      \
Condition  Body
  /  \      / \
 "x" "<"   ":=" 
      |    /  \
     "10" "x" "-"
             |
            "1"
```

### Emacs Lisp for AST Manipulation
- You can use Lisp data structures like lists to represent the AST nodes.
- Functions can traverse or manipulate these trees.

```lisp
(setq my-ast
  '(WhileLoop
    (Condition "x" "<" "10")
    (Body ":=" 
      ("x" "-" "1"))
    )
  )
```

### Operations on AST
1. **Traversal**: Walking through the tree to read or manipulate it.
2. **Transformation**: Modifying the tree to optimize the code, often during an "optimization" phase.
3. **Code Generation**: Using the AST to generate executable code, usually as a final step in a compilation process.

### Advantages
- Easier to manipulate than raw source code for transformations and optimizations.
- Language-agnostic way to analyze the structure of a program.
