### Mathematical Framework
- Syntactic analysis uses formal grammars like Context-Free Grammar (CFG) to model language rules mathematically.

> Syntactic analysis operates at the intersection of computational theory and practical computing, employing mathematical models for language syntax and finding applications in areas like AI and NLP.

### [[Finite Automata]] and Parsing
- Lexical analysis can be modeled as a finite state machine (FSM), which also finds applications in compiler design.

### Parsing and Computational Theory

- Parsing algorithms like LR parsing are akin to state transition systems in finite automata.
- Issues of decidability and algorithmic efficiency are central.

### Applications in AI and NLP

- Syntactic analysis is crucial for text processing, linking to [[Finite Automata]]'s role in NLP and CFG's relevance in AI.
